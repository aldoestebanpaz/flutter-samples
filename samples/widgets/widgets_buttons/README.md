* FloatingActionButton in Scaffold class

**New button classes vs deprecated ones difference**
Each new button class has its own theme: TextButtonTheme, ElevatedButtonTheme, and OutlinedButtonTheme. The original ButtonTheme class is no longer used. The appearance of buttons is specified by a ButtonStyle object, instead of a large set of widget parameters and properties. This is roughly comparable to the way that the appearance of text is defined with a TextStyle object. The new button themes are also configured with a ButtonStyle object. A ButtonStyle is itself just a collection of visual properties. Many of these properties are defined with MaterialStateProperty, which means that their value can depend on the buttonâ€™s state.
